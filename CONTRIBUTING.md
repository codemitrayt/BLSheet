# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ActiveAdmin! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/codemitrayt/BLSheet/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features to ActiveAdmin, please include tests.

## Where do I go from here?

For any questions, support, or ideas, etc. [please create a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/codemitrayt/BLSheet/discussions/new/choose). If you've noticed a bug, [please submit an issue][new issue].
